This is a simple website for a clone of Tweeter made using ReactJs and Firebase.

This website has the functionality to write posts, see posts, profile section, and users section; inside the profile section, there is a feed, followers, and following section.

In the home page posts of the user are shown and the posts of other users whom the current user has followed are shown.

Current Users can follow and unfollow a user and according to its home feed will be updated.

This website also has a feature to log in as a user.
UI and UX used here are made simple to use and in making the UI of this website I have used material ui.
